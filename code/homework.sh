#!/bin/bash

# this script must accept one user argument string (optional)
# Example usage:
# ./homework.sh apple
#
# or
#
# ./homework.sh
#
# Then build and run the 'app' here in this dir
# and if user has not provided any argument, then output 
# the random word only.
#
# Example:
#
# ./homework.sh
#
# and ./app outputs:
#
# Output:
# apple
#
# then this script must only output:
# apple

echo "Lol"

# put user 1st argument into variable

# build and run app | parse its output

# output result if any
